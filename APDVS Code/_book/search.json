    "text": "4.2 Introduction\nHemispheric Stroke related to carotid stenosis is a leading cause of both disability and death in the United States. Underlying etiologies for stroke include occlusive or hemorrhagic events with roughly 80% being related to occlusive pathology through embolus or in-situ thrombosis, the remaining 20% attributable to hemorrhage. Roughly 15% of stroke victims have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) that fully resolved prior to a later stroke event. Risk factors for carotid plaque formation are related to age, smoking, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and family history of stroke. Due to carotid bulb anatomy, the most common area of plaque formation is within the proximal internal carotid artery. As plaque stenosis increases over time, the systolic velocity increases to maintain flow volumes which intensifies shear stress. This shear stress increases likelihood of plaque rupture, platelet aggregation and thromboembolization. There are multiple seminal studies that describe cohort comparisons of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis with outcomes related to optimal medical management alone or as adjunct to surgical repair. Symptomatic carotid stenosis is described as carotid stenosis >50% with unilateral stroke, TIA or amaurosis fugax on the side of carotid disease. Amaurosis fugax is historically described as shade coming down across one eye on the side of stenosis to produce complete monocular visual loss related to transient retinal ischemia."

    "text": "4.3 Etiology\nAtherosclerosis is the most common cause for the development of carotid artery disease. This process is defined by deposition of lipid-laden plaque at the carotid bifurcation, and potentially across a larger territory of the common carotid, external carotid, and internal carotid arteries. This plaque may contain varying degrees of calcification and/or thrombus. The mechanisms by which atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation may lead to stroke or TIA are: occlusion (cessation of blood flow to the internal carotid artery) or embolization (plaque debris break off and travel through the internal carotid artery to the brain). There are various risk factors which may contribute to the degree of atherosclerosis and its progression. These include history of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, advanced age, and family history of carotid disease or stroke."

    "section": "4.4 Diagnostics and Imaging",
    "text": "4.4 Diagnostics and Imaging\nThree primary imaging modalities are used to evaluate carotid artery stenosis with the lowest cost option being color flow duplex ultrasound (DSA) that allows a physician to determine peak systolic and end diastolic velocities throughout the carotid bifurcation. Based on the internally validated vascular laboratory criteria of the institution, these velocities can be correlated to ranges of degree of stenosis, with high grade stenosis defined as >70-80%. Since the modality is based primarily on velocity range, it cannot give exact stenosis such as 66%. The modality can also provide adjunct information about the blood flow waveforms in each arterial segment, as well as whether that flow is laminar or turbulent with utilization of color flow imaging. Limitations of this imaging include technician skill, inability to obtain optimal angle of doppler interrogation for velocity determination, shadowing from heavily calcified lesions, poor visualization due to patient habitus and tortuosity.\nAxial imaging options include both Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) and Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA). Both of these two options require some form of intra-arterial contrast either iodinated contrast or gadolinium, respectively. However, they offer a fuller perspective of relevant anatomy and a more precise determination of stenosis within the limitations of the modality, with MRA often overestimating the degree of stenosis due to intrinsic properties of MRA imaging acquisition. Both CTA and MRA, although superior to DSA in determination of exact degree of plaque stenosis and arterial anatomy, sacrifice the physiologic information offered through DSA that speak to flow patterns, flow direction and turbulence. Axial imaging of CTA and MRA can define patency but do not speak to the dynamic nature of blood flow or directionality of flow.\nDefinitive determination of flow and directionality can be augmented to a carotid artery stenosis workup by diagnostic angiography. This requires femoral artery access and includes contrast administration, as well as a small risk of periprocedural embolization. However, it offers additional physiologic evaluation that might not be present in DSA and that is inherently lacking in CTA and MRA studies."

    "text": "4.5 Treatment\n\n4.5.1 Carotid Artery Endarterectomy (CEA)\nProcedure has been performed since the 1950s either with plaque endarterectomy with patch angioplasty or with primary arterial repair. To prevent arterial restenosis, patch angioplasty has become the standard of arterial closure after plaque removal. The procedure can involve cerebral monitoring including EEG, TCD and stump pressure monitoring or be performed awake to directly monitor patient motor response. Patch repair can be performed under a “clamp and sew” mentality or with an arterial shunt to maintain cerebral perfusion during endarterectomy and patch repair. Risks include cardiopulmonary risk of acute myocardial ischemia, <3% perioperative risk of neurologic event, neck hematoma or cranial nerve injury of roughly 5-10% affecting the vagus, marginal mandibular, recurrent laryngeal or hypoglossal nerves.\n\n\n4.5.2 Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)\n\n4.5.2.1 Transfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS) with Embolic Protection\nTransfemoral stenting requires some type of protection from embolization including a distal internal carotid artery retrievable filter or flow arrest procedure to prevent cerebral embolization during stent placement with or without angioplasty.\n\n\n4.5.2.2 Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)\nTreatment of a carotid stenosis that avoids aortic arch manipulation involving direct common carotid artery exposure and sheath placement to allow for transcarotid stent delivery to the internal carotid artery. The common carotid artery sheath is connected to a femoral vein sheath so that the natural arterial pressure gradient reverses flow across the distal internal carotid artery driving blood and embolus into the arterial tubing circuit and across a filter before it reenters the venous circulation. FDA approval for the device was delivered in 2016 so the technology is still less than 10 years old without robust long-term follow up. This technique offers a lower perioperative stroke risk than transfemoral stenting, for multiple reasons including lack of transaortic arch manipulation and great vessel cannulation which can result in embolus prior to placement of an internal carotid artery embolic protection device.\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Optimal Medical Management\nUnderstandably, optimal medical management requires full risk evaluation of the individual patient in question including other comorbidities, drug allergies, compliance, etc., we have listed a few broad recommendations to follow that offer general guidance surrounding the dynamic target of optimal medical management for arterial disease.\n\n4.5.3.1 Antiplatelet Therapy\n\nASA offers a 22% risk reduction in major vascular events with no difference in protection based on dosage (81 versus 325 mg).\nClopidogrel can be used as an adjunct or alternative to ASA, but the added benefit from dual antiplatelet combination in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is unproven.\n\n\n\n4.5.3.2 Anticoagulants\n\nOnly useful for prevention of stroke in cardioembolic strokes due to arrhythmia or prosthetic valve.\n\n\n\n4.5.3.3 Hypertension Treatment\n\nRecommended blood pressure range of <130/80 with individual antihypertensive regimen based on other comorbidities and patient risk factors.\n\n\n\n4.5.3.4 Diabetic Control\n\nIn accordance with best practice for diabetes management, the patient’s hemoglobin A1c should be <7.0\n\n\n\n4.5.3.5 Smoking Cessation\n\nTreatments offered include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline or bupropion as first line agents.\n\n\n\n4.5.3.6 Hyperlipidemia Management\n\nRegimen goals of LDL <100mg/dl, or <70mg/dl depending on risk profile."

    "text": "4.6 Outcomes\n\n4.6.1 Asymptomatic carotid stenosis\n\nThe historically touted Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) demonstrated that patients with >60% carotid stenosis who underwent CEA benefited significantly from stroke risk reduction at 5 years (5.1% for CEA vs. 11% for optimal medical therapy consisting of aspirin alone).\nMore recent contemporary studies suggest that with the current optimal medical management, which consists of antiplatelet medication and statin therapy, 5-year stroke risk is highest in patients with >70% carotid stenosis, and therefore this patient population would benefit from carotid endarterectomy.\nPatients who are deemed high risk, either due to an anatomic(such as surgically inaccessible bifurcation or restenosis after previous CEA) or physiologic finding (congestive heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), may be considered for TCAR given the equivocal results of perioperative stroke or death at 1.3%, as compared to CEA.\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Symptomatic carotid stenosis\n\nPatients who have >50% carotid stenosis and have developed symptoms of TIA or stroke were found to benefit from CEA in the pivotal North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) because of the significant 2-year stroke risk reduction as compared to optimal medical management (15.7% vs. 22.2%.). An even great stroke risk reduction was seen in patients with >70% carotid stenosis (9% CEA vs. 26% medical management).\nCurrent management of patients with symptomatic >50% carotid stenosis who are low/standard risk is carotid endarterectomy over transfemoral carotid stenting (TFCAS), as there are no studies to date which have shown benefit of TFCAS.\nPatients who are deemed high risk, as defined above, may be considered for TCAR over TFCAS due to the significantly lower incidence of in-hospital stroke and death (1.6% vs. 3.1%)."

Interacting with the patient and family during the history and physical is extremely important to build rapport with the patients and their family.\nFor vascular patients passing the “eyeball test” is important before discussing complex procedures. This includes knowing the level of independent living."

    "text": "2.3 Patient History of the Arterial System\nAs a vascular specialist, a focused arterial history should include the arteries of the neck, torso, and extremities. Many diseases are systemic. For example, atherosclerotic disease affects the carotids, heart, upper extremities, abdominal blood vessels, and lower extremities. Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm may have synchronous peripheral aneurysms.\n\n2.3.1 Head and Neck:\n\nThe history should focus on the carotid arteries’ disease (Link to chapter)—specifically, any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks ( TIA), or amaurosis fugax.\nAmaurosis fugax is described as a curtain or shade causing transient monocular blindness. This is usually caused by emboli from the carotid disease on the ipsilateral side but may be caused by other embolic sources, migraine, and giant cell arteritis.\nSyncopal episodes are usually not vascular in nature. However, in patients with subclavian stenosis may be a manifestation of subclavian steal syndrome.\nHistory of carotid interventions and studies should be elucidated and obtained.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Upper Extremity:\n\nThe evaluation depends on the timing (acute vs. chronic) and then the degree of ischemia (claudication vs. chronic limb-threatening ischemia) .\nAcute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden occlusion of the blood supply with no time for collateral vessels to develop. It is characterized by the 6 Ps. Pulselessness, pain, pallor, paresthesia, poikilothermia (cold), and paralysis. The most common etiology of acute limb ischemia is embolic. However, uncommon causes may be thrombosis of a subclavian–axillary aneurysm.\nIntermittent hand coldness associated with pain, numbness may reflect Raynaud’s syndrome (associated with cold exposure) or small vessel vasospasm like frostbite or scleroderma.\nRaynaud phenomena present as episodes of vasospasm in response to cold or stress. The patient describes the affected areas turning white, blue, and red during an attack. It is associated with feeling cold and numb. As the circulation improves and the affected areas turn red, there is throbbing, tingling, and swelling.\nEpisodes of ischemia to the digits may be persistent and severe and associated with underlying obliterative microangiopathy and manifest with pain, tissue loss (ulceration or gangrene).\nChronic ischemia of the upper extremity is uncommon can manifest with arm claudication (exertional fatigue). The etiology is most commonly proximal obstruction due to atherosclerotic disease in the subclavian artery. More uncommon causes are Takayasu arteritis and thoracic outlet syndrome.\n\nExertion of the arm causing posterior cerebral circulation symptoms (diplopia, dysarthria, dizziness, drop attacks, vertigo, syncope, and ataxia) may reflect a subclavian steal syndrome caused by subclavian artery stenosis proximal to the vertebral artery.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Abdomen:\n\nAneurysm disease in the abdomen is usually silent.\nWith weight loss and sitophobia (food fear), postprandial pain may reflect mesenteric artery stenosis.\nSevere hypertension, especially in young adults, may reflect renal artery stenosis.\n\nAortoiliac occlusive disease may present with Leriche’s syndrome. Leriche’s syndrome is defined as bilateral hip and buttock claudication, absent femoral pulses, and impotence.\n\nAcute abdominal pain has multiple nonvascular etiologies. A ruptured aneurysm presents severe pain radiating to the back with a pulsatile abdominal mass. Acute mesenteric ischemia manifests as pain out of proportion to the physical exam.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Lower Extremities:\n\nThe evaluation depends on the timing (acute vs. chronic) and then the degree of ischemia (claudication vs. chronic limb-threatening ischemia).\nAcute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden occlusion of the blood supply with no time for collateral vessels to develop. It is characterized by the 6 Ps. Pulselessness, pain, pallor, paresthesia, poikilothermia (cold), and paralysis.\nChronic limb ischemia is frequently asymptomatic and diagnosed on physical exam or vascular lab testing. In asymptomatic disease related to atherosclerotic disease, medical therapy is initiated to prevent disease progression.\nClaudication is defined by cramping pain in the leg induced by exercise and relieved by rest. It occurs at a fixed and reproducible distance and resolves with rest. The pain is described as discomfort, cramp, numbness, or tiredness in the legs. Claudication most commonly occurs in the calf muscles, but it can also affect the feet, thighs, hips, buttocks. It is crucial to determine how the patient’s lifestyle is affected when taking a history. With proper medical therapy, including medication and exercise, claudication improves> 50% of the time. Fewer than 5% progress to amputation. Amputation is more frequent in patients who continue to smoke, have uncontrolled diabetes, and have renal failure. Differential diagnosis of claudication is in Table 1 below. Table 1 is also helpful in differentiating between other types of leg pain, pseudo claudication, and true claudication.\n\nChronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). These patients have multiple levels of arterial disease and are at risk of amputation. CLTI manifests as rest pain or tissue loss. Rest pain is characterized as pain in the dorsum of the foot and toes. It is increased with leg elevation and may wake the patient up at night and is relieved by dangling the limb, which increases perfusion by enlisting gravity to help perfuse the leg. Tissue loss can be in the form of an ulcer or gangrene."

This resource is a summary and is by no means comprehensive. That noted, in every chapter we have included links to additional resources if you wish to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topics covered. As our mission is to make vascular surgery education accessible, we prioritize open access publications and free materials. A few highly recommended additional resources include:\n\nThe Audible Bleeding Exam Prep curriculum and the associated podcast series.\n\nWhile this resource is intended for postgraduate trainees and fellows and therefore beyond the scope of this curriculum, it is a well authored, no-nonsense resource for those who wish to deepen their knowledge base.\nThe accompanying podcast series also allows you to learn or study on the go!\nYou can listen to Audible Bleeding episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, or Soundcloud\n\nTeachMe Surgery is a student friendly online resource complete with short quizzes to help cement learning and recommended readings from the literature. Clear and concise, this is a great just-in-time learning resource.\nThe Audible Bleeding Medical Student Archive contains podcast episodes tailored for medical students.\n\nWe suggest paying special attention to the Holding Pressure series. Whereas this eBook is organized by disease, Holding Pressure episodes are organized by surgical procedure. These episodes contain a wealth of high-yield information and we will include links to Holding Pressure episodes throughout the eBook when applicable.\nYou can listen to Audible Bleeding episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, or Soundcloud"

## Additional Resources

We hope you use this eBook as a review for your rotations, undergraduate medical licencing examinations, and entry to independent practice. This resource is a summary and is by no means comprehensive. That noted, in every chapter we have included links to additional resources if you wish to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topics covered. As our mission is to make vascular surgery education accessible, we prioritize open access publications and free materials. A few highly recommended additional resources include:

-   The [Audible Bleeding Exam Prep curriculum](https://adam-mdmph.quarto.pub/vascular-surgery-exam-prep/) and the associated podcast series.

    -   While this resource is intended for postgraduate trainees and fellows and therefore beyond the scope of this curriculum, it is a well authored, no-nonsense resource for those who wish to deepen their knowledge base.
    -   The accompanying podcast series also allows you to learn or study on the go!
    -   You can listen to Audible Bleeding episodes on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/audible-bleeding/id1440614377), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5EPvNmAGD38OCNB68rXBaJ), [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/search/audible%20bleeding), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/show/audible-bleeding), or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-868527834)

-   [TeachMe Surgery](https://teachmesurgery.com/vascular/) is a student friendly online resource complete with short quizzes to help cement learning and recommended readings from the literature. Clear and concise, this is a great just-in-time learning resource.

-   The [Audible Bleeding Medical Student Archive](https://www.audiblebleeding.com/episodes-1/?tag=Medical+Student) contains podcast episodes tailored for medical students.

    -   We suggest paying special attention to the *Holding Pressure* series. Whereas this eBook is organized by disease, *Holding Pressure* episodes are organized by surgical procedure. These episodes contain a wealth of high-yield information and we will include links to *Holding Pressure* episodes throughout the eBook when applicable.

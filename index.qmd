## Additional Resources

We hope you use this eBook as a review for your rotations, medical lisencing examinations, and entry to independent practice. This resource is by no means comprehensive. We have done our best to reference and link to more comprehensive resources throughout the text so that you can dive deeper into topics that are beyond the scope of this review. We try to prioritize open access publications and free, high quality, unbiased materials. A few highly recommended additional resources include:

-   The [Audible Bleeding Exam Prep curriculum](https://adam-mdmph.quarto.pub/vascular-surgery-exam-prep/) and the associated podcast series.

-   While this resource is intended for postgraduate trainees and fellows and therefore beyond the scope of this curriculum, it is a well authored, no-nonsense resource for those who wish to deepen their knowledge base.

-   The accompanying podcast series also allows you to learn or study on the go!

-   [TeachMe Surgery](https://teachmesurgery.com/vascular/) is a student friendly online resource complete with short quizzes to help cement learning and recommended readings from the literature. Clear and concise, this is a great just-in-time learning resource.
